# Loopring Hackathon Challenges

## Challange#1: Oedax UI

## Description

Create a web UI to display open and ended auctions, integrate the UI with MetaMask and allow users to lock their Ethereum account to participate in existing open auctions.

The UI does not need to allow anyone to create new auctions.

## About Oedax Protocol

Please read the [Oedax blog post](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/oedax-looprings-open-ended-dutch-auction-exchange-model-d92cebbd3667) regarding its design.

We've also created this little [tool](https://loopring.github.io/protocols/curve.html) to show you how the Oedax curves look like in our current implementation.

## Auction Interface
The Oedax Auction's interface is defined in this [IAuction](https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/blob/master/packages/oedax_v1/contracts/iface/IAuction.sol) solidity file.

The ABI files can be found in our github repository - link (TODO)
